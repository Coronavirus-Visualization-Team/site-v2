The project aims to use natural language processing via a machine learning model for sentiment analysis on an ongoing collection of Tweets associated with the novel coronavirus COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). The current project focuses on identifying data related to xenophobia, or more specifically sinophobia. This data will be analyzed to see how recent online internet activity associated with the aforementioned categories may have increased or decreased with the current global circumstances. Moving forward, the scope of this project may be broadened to encompass international relations and interactions, seeing how people across the world are reacting to the developing events, and thereby derive behavioural insights from such information.
