The Socioeconomic Measures project is aimed at using different socioeconomic variables to find correlations with coronavirus cases so we can predict cases in different zip codes. We will use machine learning and other analysis tools to find these correlations as well as different statistical strategies to visualize these correlations and find ways to combat the virus.
