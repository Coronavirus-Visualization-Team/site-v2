The focus of this project revolves around an impact study, a quantitative analysis of industry markets, and a review on strategies uptaken by the three largest U.S. financial technology companies: Stripe, Ripple, and Coinbase. We are currently evaluating the impact COVID-19 has had on FinTech, the effectiveness of strategies to meet an increase in service demands, new challenges and opportunities, as well as the impact on small businesses through loans provided by Fintech companies. Members will work on compiling data from FinTech information companies such as CB Insights and then analyzing to find successful reactions to increases/decreases in demand and resources. The goal of this project is to provide startup companies in the FinTech industry with information and strategies on how to survive in the current and upcoming economic climate.
