The “COVID-19 Infection Prediction” (CIP) project is extremely interesting in that it has a potentially simple conclusion, but one that is complicated to reach. The probability of catching the coronavirus is a function of several variables, such as age; location; what time you leave your house during lockdown; health guidelines; and length of time between exposure and infection. This list of variables is far from comprehensive, with some being more difficult to work with than others. The crowning achievement will be an easy-to-use function that informs policymakers and the general public on the probability of specific people contracting COVID-19, based on their surrounding environment.
