The whole premise of the project is to determine whether the goals of the EPA's environmental rollbacks were met during the coronavirus outbreak. The agency believed that rolling back air pollution regulations would help fossil fuel industries during this difficult economic period and would not harm the environment. The project will be looking into climate and economic data to back up our recommendation to the EPA on whether they should reinstall these air pollution regulations as they prevent pollutants, such as PM 2.5, from harming public health.
