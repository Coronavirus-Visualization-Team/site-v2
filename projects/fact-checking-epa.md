Recently, the EPA has rolled back several air pollution regulations, justifying their actions by stating that doing so will not negatively impact the environment and will actually bolster the economic viability of fossil fuel industries. The objective of this project is to see whether the EPA rollback regulations are having their intended effects. The final product of this project is to create a policy proposal that recommends a course of action on whether to revise or maintain the current environmental policies.
