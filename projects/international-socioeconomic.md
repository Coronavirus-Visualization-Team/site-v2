The focus of this project is to visualize the effects various socioeconomic factors have on the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic internationally. Using a diverse set of indexes, we hope to be able to pinpoint the factors that have the greatest effect on the transmission of the virus on a global scale. The end goal of this project is to provide policymakers with data-supported factors that need to be addressed in order to control the pandemic, as well as prevent future outbreaks.
