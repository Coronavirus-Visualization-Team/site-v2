The goal of this project is to create a map in ArcGIS that displays hospitals and nearby 3D printing facilities that are producing medical supplies (ventilators, facemasks). It seeks to efficiently connect hospitals to nearby suppliers. The end goal of this project is to create an interactive interface that can allow hospitals in need to request the necessary supplies from the closest 3D printing facilities. This project relies on reaching out to equipment makers and hospitals to acquire the information above.
