The goal of the project is to figure out a way different countries may be misinforming the public about the amount of COVID-19 cases. There are many different factors that we are going to be looking into (write-off to different diseases, lack of testing, labeling expired patients as recovered, etc.). Everyone will have a fair share of work, you can choose the country you want to investigate.
