The focus of this project is contacting MIT Innovation Initiative, Harvard Innovation Labs and other organizations (such as campus publications and data science clubs) for partnerships and help. Another focus of this project is taking advantage of and applying to the many hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding and credits available. What we would like to obtain from the partnerships and grants we apply to consists of (1) having more resources that can be used to support the research that other projects are working on, (2) increasing awareness of CVT, so that more people can help with our projects and help us work towards our mission of helping the general public understand the situation with COVID-19, and (3) spreading the information we gather and the media we prepare to a larger audience.
