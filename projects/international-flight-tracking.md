This project aims to identify the impact of COVID-19 on global supply chains, with an emphasis on the aviation industry and international trade. We are primarily focused on the aviation industry, and some subtopics including financial positions of aviation companies, correlation between flight volume and infections etc. Additionally we will create a centralised platform viewing important information on international travel between countries during the pandemic.
