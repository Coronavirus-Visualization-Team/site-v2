The main focus of this project is to study and analyze actions of Korea that allowed them to successfully manage COVID-19 in three parts: Government Policies and Laws, Use of Innovative Technology, and Healthcare Systems. We are establishing partnerships with several healthcare companies in Korea that contributed to the containment of COVID-19 including Eone Diagnomics Genome Center, Solgent, and mygenomebox. Partnerships with these companies will allow us to access valuable data SDK, specifically on testing kits and healthcare systems, public health policy expertise through interviews, and valuable networks. Members will work on creating visualizations based on the data provided by these companies, conduct direct interviews with the EDGC COVID-19 Response Team, and participate in possible collaboration projects.
