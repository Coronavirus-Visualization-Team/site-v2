The focus of the project is to provide a better understanding of environmental factors influencing the spread and infection rate of COVID-19. Some research shows that COVID-19 may be a seasonal respiratory virus affected by climate, and this project will dive deeper into the specific environmental influences that affect the novel coronavirus. By gathering datasets and information about climate in different areas of the world in specific times as well as the infection rate of COVID-19 in those locations, we can deliver a comprehensive collection of data visualizations as well as accurate and useful info for our paper that health officials can use for future planning as well as informing the public on what influences the virus. If COVID-19 is indeed a seasonal respiratory virus as previous research has suggested, then offering a clearer understanding of the virus can help make officials make more informed decisions regarding the virus.
