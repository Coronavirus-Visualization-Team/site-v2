The mental health project seeks to uncover the relationship between mental health and COVID-19. How have suicide rates been affected by COVID-19, how many people are using telemedicine now, what are singles feeling with social isolation? 
In the mental health project, you are in charge of your own journey. You are free to create visuals about anything albeit it must relate to mental health. Dive deep into suicide, depression, find datasets, the sky is the limit. The only prerequisite for joining is having an open mind and a curiosity to learn how COVID-19 has shaped the mental health landscape.
