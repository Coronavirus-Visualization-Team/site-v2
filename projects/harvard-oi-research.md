This project is assisting Opportunity Insights by collecting county-level economic data, particularly unemployment insurance claims and bankruptcy claims. The focal point of this project would be a collection of real-time public data to create well-processed, high-quality datasets from unstructured data which will be analyzed by researchers and be used to translate these research findings into policy change. Our main deliverable is a github and airtable of links. For real-life problems and insights into the same, we need data that originated from the problem domains. Some of the important tasks in this research project include Data selection: the selection of the right features for a particular dataset, Data preprocessing and sampling: organizing and formatting the data, cleaning the data, and Feature Engineering and extraction: optimizing the number of features and Data Conversion: Scaling and Composition-combining different features into a single feature; to create datasets with balanced taxonomy, sufficient data, high-quality labels/data, minimal errors and diversification of samples.
