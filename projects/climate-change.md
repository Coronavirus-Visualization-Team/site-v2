The focus of this project is to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on pre-existing economic and social inequities that are propelled by climate change. There are many datasets that record air quality in various places and update this in real-time to a dataset. This project will create geospatial visualizations of air quality before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in various communities, conduct data analysis on the data collected, and ultimately see the correlation of this data with household income/racial trends of various communities that can prove useful in both determining the likelihood of communities becoming infected with the coronavirus and in proposing policy.
