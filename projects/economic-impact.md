The main goal of this project is to collect and provide information about the Economic consequences of the COVID pandemic. There are several data available regarding the health impact of the virus, however, economic data, especially in an industry-specific and state/county level is scarce. In the near future, governments will need to balance the Health and Economic impacts when making crucial decisions regarding social distancing and lockdowns. Either through visualization platforms like Tableau and ArcGIS or through academic papers reflecting on the data collected, we aim to have a real impact by helping policymakers and informing the general public. We want to use economic measures to measure what has changed because of the pandemic, how much it has changed, and why.
