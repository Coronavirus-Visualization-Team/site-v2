The focus of this project is to analyze the direction of the economy based on the implementation of current short-term banking policies, analysis of the PPP, EILP, and other business relief programs and their effectivity, the current state of US treasuries and what their lower interest rates as a result of recent federal reserve policy could mean for government funding and investors. Overall, we are trying to reveal the true economic desperation of the economy right now that conventional news media is not focusing on in order to maintain public confidence. The project also serves to provide different solutions and the economic results that can be expected from them.
