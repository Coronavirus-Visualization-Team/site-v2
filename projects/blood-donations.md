The goal of the Blood Donation project is to track the number of blood donations over time, and see if there is a change in the number of blood donations during the COVID-19 pandemic. We would like to visualize and find out where hospitals and medical centers are facing shortages of blood, so organizations and the public can have more information about this crucial issue.
