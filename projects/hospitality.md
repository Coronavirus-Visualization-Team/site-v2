The goal of this project is to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the hospitality industry. The hospitality is very complex and has a variety of different parts. It can even be considered to be a microcosm for different human behaviors. As a result, understanding how certain parts of the hospitality industry vary effect-wise, during, and after COVID-19 could prove to be incredibly important. We will use a data-driven approach to studying this using as much data as we can possibly find in the hospitality industry. Hopefully, this will result in a publication of some sort â€” whether it be in the news, or otherwise.
